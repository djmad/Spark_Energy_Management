# Updates and removal

[← README](../README.md) · [Installation](installation.md) · [Usage](usage.md)

A module file is built for one kernel. Installing a new file does not replace
a module already loaded in memory. Keep NVIDIA's normal OS/firmware update
process; check this driver's build and operation before relying on extra cooling.

## Kernel updates with DKMS

With the [DKMS route](installation.md#3a-dkms-builds-for-kernel-updates), package
hooks normally rebuild and sign the registered source for newly installed
kernels. They do not update this project's source or Python service.

Before rebooting into a new kernel, set its **exact installed release name**
(the directory name under `/lib/modules`) and verify the build:

```sh
# Replace the example with the kernel you are about to boot.
new_kernel="6.17.0-1029-nvidia"
sudo apt-get install "linux-headers-$new_kernel"
sudo dkms install -m dgx-spark-fan-control -v 0.1.3 -k "$new_kernel"
dkms status -m dgx-spark-fan-control
modinfo -k "$new_kernel" -F vermagic dgx_ec_fan_control
modinfo -k "$new_kernel" -F signer dgx_ec_fan_control
```

Expect `installed` for that kernel and the intended signing identity. DKMS
reuses the configured certificate; no repeat enrollment is needed unless the
key changes. A failed rebuild is not fixed by copying a `.ko` from an old kernel.
Resolve build failures before depending on this controller after reboot.

After booting the new kernel:

```sh
uname -r
dgx-fan-control status
systemctl is-active dgx-fan-control.service
sudo journalctl -k -b | grep -E 'dgx|fan.floor|arm.ffa'
```

`inactive` is expected if you chose factory-curve/manual-boost mode. In that
mode, status should initially show `state=0/12`. With the performance service
enabled, the state follows temperature. Firmware updates also require this
check: a successful kernel build does not prove a changed EC contract works.

## Kernel updates with manual builds

From your checkout, after installing the new kernel's matching headers:

```sh
# Replace the example with the kernel you are about to boot.
new_kernel="6.17.0-1029-nvidia"
sudo apt-get install "linux-headers-$new_kernel"
KERNEL_RELEASE="$new_kernel" ./scripts/build-sign
sudo install -D -m 0644 kernel/dgx_ec_fan_control.ko \
  "/lib/modules/$new_kernel/updates/dgx_ec_fan_control.ko"
sudo depmod -a "$new_kernel"
modinfo -k "$new_kernel" -F vermagic dgx_ec_fan_control
modinfo -k "$new_kernel" -F signer dgx_ec_fan_control
```

Use the same `DGX_MOK_DIR` override as at installation, if any. On a system
without signature enforcement, the unsigned equivalent is
`make -C kernel KDIR="/lib/modules/$new_kernel/build" clean all`.
After reboot, perform the status checks above.

## Update this project's source

Do this between jobs. First restore automatic control and unload the existing
module; do not proceed if restoration or readback fails. A persistently pending
relay needs [maintenance recovery](troubleshooting.md#persistent-pending-and-service-exit-69)
before the new module can be loaded safely:

```sh
sudo systemctl stop dgx-fan-control.service
sudo dgx-fan-control automatic
dgx-fan-control status                    # require state=0/12
sudo modprobe -r dgx_ec_fan_control
git pull --ff-only
./scripts/check
```

Then follow the route you originally installed:

- **Manual:** repeat the manual build/sign/install commands for the running
  kernel. Also rebuild for other installed kernels you intend to boot.
- **DKMS:** remove the old registered version with
  `sudo dkms remove -m dgx-spark-fan-control -v 0.1.0 --all`
  when upgrading from 0.1.0 (check `dkms status` for your installed version),
  then repeat the source-copy, add, build, and install steps in the installation
  guide. Use the
  version in the new checkout's `dkms.conf` (currently `0.1.3`) wherever the
  commands name a version. This also refreshes a changed checkout that retains
  the same version; `git pull` alone does not refresh DKMS's stored source.
  Build for every additional installed kernel you intend to boot.

Refresh the command and service definition, then load and check the new module:

```sh
sudo install -D -m 0755 userspace/dgx_fan_control.py /usr/local/sbin/dgx-fan-control
sudo install -D -m 0644 systemd/dgx-fan-control.service \
  /etc/systemd/system/dgx-fan-control.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo modprobe dgx_ec_fan_control
dgx-fan-control status
```

If you want the performance curve again, run
`sudo systemctl start dgx-fan-control.service`. Otherwise leave it stopped for
NVIDIA's factory curve. Existing boot enablement is preserved.

## Switch from manual installation to DKMS

Restore automatic mode and unload the module as above. Remove the manually
installed file for the running kernel:

```sh
sudo rm -f "/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/updates/dgx_ec_fan_control.ko"
sudo depmod -a
```

Repeat for any other kernel where you manually installed this exact file. Then
follow the DKMS installation route and load/verify the result. Removing manual
copies first avoids DKMS backing one up and restoring it during later removal.

## Uninstall

### 1. Restore the factory curve before removing anything

```sh
sudo systemctl disable --now dgx-fan-control.service
sudo dgx-fan-control automatic
dgx-fan-control status                    # require state=0/12
sudo modprobe -r dgx_ec_fan_control
```

If restoration, readback, or unload fails, stop here and consult
[troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md). Do not discard the tools needed to
inspect and restore a failed state.

### 2. Remove the module using your installation method

For DKMS (substitute your installed version if different):

```sh
sudo dkms remove -m dgx-spark-fan-control -v 0.1.3 --all
dkms status -m dgx-spark-fan-control
```

For a manual installation:

```sh
sudo rm -f "/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/updates/dgx_ec_fan_control.ko"
sudo depmod -a
```

Repeat manual removal for other kernels where you installed it. DKMS source
under `/usr/src/dgx-spark-fan-control-0.1.3` can be removed separately once no
registered version uses it.

### 3. Remove startup entries and the userland command

```sh
sudo rm -f /etc/modules-load.d/dgx_ec_fan_control.conf
sudo rm -f /etc/systemd/system/dgx-fan-control.service
sudo rm -f /usr/local/sbin/dgx-fan-control
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Keep signing keys, enrolled certificates, and system-wide DKMS signing settings
if other modules depend on them. Uninstalling this controller does not require
changing Secure Boot enrollment.
